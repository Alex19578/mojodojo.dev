# mojodojo.dev
This website is for learning resources for the Mojo programming language.

It's built with [VuePress V2](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/getting-started.html) which is currently in beta, the main configuration comes from [vuepresss.config.ts](vuepress.config.ts), [vuepress.client.ts](vuepress.client.ts) currently just has some redirects to keep old social media links alive, while the css and static images can be modified in [.vuepress/public](.vuepress/public) and [.vuepress/styles](.vuepress/styles)

The homepage comes from [index.md](index.md), with [tutorials.md](tutorials.md) and [blog.md](blog.md) acting as single pages which you can download to play with locally. Keep track of updates in [this_week_in_mojo.md](this_week_in_mojo.md) or add your own content with a pull request if you want to promote something.
