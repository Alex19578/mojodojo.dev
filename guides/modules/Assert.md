usage: Place constraints on functions that are checked at compile time, and check conditions only in debug builds

# Assert
## assert_param
Asserts that the condition is true in the `parameter / comptime` domain, used to place constraints on functions


```mojo
from Assert import assert_param
```

We can put compile time assertions in the ensure that the two numbers passed in are positive


```mojo
fn add_positives[x: Int, y: Int]() -> UInt8:
    assert_param[x > 0]()
    assert_param[y > 0]()
    return x + y
```

Let's get the result that's calculated at compile time


```mojo
let res = add_positives[2, 4]()
print(res)
```

    6


Now we'll introduce the error so you can see how it looks, it will always be at the end of the error message:


```mojo
let res1 = add_positives[3, 5]()
print(res1) # output : 8
```


## assert_param_msg

This works the same way as [assert_param](#assert-param) but you can add a custom error message at the end:


```mojo
from Assert import assert_param_msg

fn add_positives[x: Int, y: Int]() -> UInt8:
    assert_param_msg[x > 0, "x is not positve, use a positve number over 0"]()
    return x + y

let res = add_positives[-2, -4]()
print(res)
```

    error: Expression [5]:11:1: no viable expansions found
    ...
    Expression [5]:7:77:               constraint failed: x is not positve, use a positve number over 0
        assert_param_msg[x > 0, "x is not positve, use a positve number over 0"]()
                                                                                ^
    


## debug_assert
Asserts that the condition is true in debug builds, and is removed from the compilation process in release builds


```mojo
from Assert import debug_assert

fn test_debug_assert[x: Int](y: Int):
    debug_assert(x == 42, "x is not equal to 42")
    debug_assert(y == 42, "y is not equal to 42")


test_debug_assert[1](2)
```

_debug_assert isn't current working in the playground_
