# This Week in Mojo 2023-06-02

_Week in Progress_

## Mojo Playground Release
[Full Changelog](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/changelog.html#section)

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New
These Python packages are now available on Mojo Playground:

- torch
- tensorflow
- polars
- opencv-python
- keras
- Pillow
- plotly
- seaborn
- sympy
- transformers

An optimization has been implemented to move an object instead of copying, if it's not used again.

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed
- [Issue #231](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/231): Unexpected error when a Python expression raises an exception
- [Issue #199](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/119): The REPL fails when a python variable is redefined

## Official Content
Blog post on the [Modular Unified Engine](https://www.modular.com/blog/accelerating-ai-model-serving-with-modulars-unified-engine) detailing the integration with NVIDIA Triton.

## Community Content
- [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21WFgScvrdg) did a high level introduction to the language

- [Maxim](https://mzaks.medium.com/) made a post about [Parsing CSV in Mojo](https://mzaks.medium.com/simple-csv-parser-in-mojo-3555c13fb5c8) and used SIMD to get speedups

- [Gautam Ethiraj](https://medium.com/@gautam.e/hello-mojo-83f5a8b04074) expressed his [Mojo FOMO](https://medium.com/@gautam.e/hello-mojo-83f5a8b04074) (Fear Of Missing Out)

## General
Guido van Rossum, Python creator and CPython core developer said this about Mojoüî• on [python.org](https://discuss.python.org/t/mojo-python-with-c-gpu-performance/26993/6):

> It‚Äôs definitely early days for Mojo. I plan to talk to Chris about how he plans it to become a true Python superset that will run existing Python code out of the box.

>So far, Mojo is a separate language (they have struct but not class, Int but not int, etc.), and their ‚ÄúCPython compatibility‚Äù strategy involves calling a helper function that you pass the name of a module, and it will import that module and execute it in CPython, returning a Mojo proxy object. It then treats CPython as a separate language runtime and when values are passed between Mojo and CPython they are ‚Äúmarshalled‚Äù (boxing/unboxing Int/int, etc.). This is syntactically very smooth, because Mojo and Python have compatible syntax (so you can write e.g. x+y where x is a Mojo value and y a CPython object), but doesn‚Äôt speed up running CPython at all.

>I presume that the reported speedups on PyTorch etc. are obtained by rewriting key parts of the PyTorch kernel in Mojo, applying the optimizations shown in the notebooks on the Mojo site.

### Implicit Type Declaration
Within a function, implicitly declared variables get the type of their first value assigned into them. This is probably not the right thing - within a def, we will need to maintain dynamic typing (including type transformations like python has) for compatibility. Our base object isn't super built out and set up for this yet, which is why we have a "default to the first type" approach.

### Generic `AnyType` 
This is mostly just a placeholder for now.  This has known problems and will need to be reworked when we get traits/typeclasses/protocols filled in.  Do you have a specific interest/concern in mind?
One problem with AnyType is that we will need to decide if it is implicitly copyable/movable, if that is trivial, etc.  There are lots of properties we'll want to be able to express elegantly; none of this has been designed, but there is a lot of prior art in rust/swift/haskell/etc.

### `let` inside `fn` definitions
Thank you for filing this. This is known (to me) to not be supported. We have the infrastructure to do this now, but we need to decide whether we want it. There are various folks (incl on this forum) that are proposing that we eliminate 'let' declarations to simplify things, and I'd rather resolve that direction before investing more time into let declarations.

Incidentally, this discussion will come up "real soon now" as it is all tangled into the lifetime proposal. This should be coming to the community for discussion in the next two weeks.

### Generics for non trivial types
This is going to be tricky to address in the immediate term. In the absence of traits/protocols (which is scheduled to start soon) we can't reason about what members a generic AnyType has, nor can we constrain that type. This is actually a pretty big deal, because we don't have the infra to map back to what a substituted type's destructors are. As a consequence of this, it is only possible to use trivial types like Int/FP with generic algorithms. This is incredibly constraining right now üôÅ

There is a separate issue where register_passable and memory-only types have different concrete ABIs / conventions. This is solvable in a simple way (just treat register passable types as memory abi when generic) or a fancier way (delay binding of ABI until type substitution)... but until we solve the trait issue, we'll still only be able to express generic algorithms over trivial types, even if they are memory only. So solving this in the immediate term isn't much of a relief.

The best workarounds right now are pretty ugly:

- Limit your generic code to trivial register passable types; e.g. add an explicit delete() method that you manually manage instead of a __del__ method that is automatically invoked.
- Copy and paste things to make them non-generic.

sorry, this is pretty annoying to me too. I really want to get on top of this of course.
