### Loose Typing
This is an evolving part of the language and likely another difference we pull into the `fn` vs `def` world, in a `def` we could default to getting objects for literals, but within a `fn` you get typed literals. Another potential solution is to have aggressive decay rules in `def` e.g. `True` starts out being typed to `Bool` but we allow decaying to object when an expression doesn't type check otherwise. We'll need to experiment with that when we make progress on other more basic things. The major reason to have both `def` and `fn` is to have a Python compatible world and a stricter systems programmer world, and have them coexist seamlessly.

### Struct Memory Layout C Compatibility
I agree that an opt-in decorator that specifies layout is the right way to go. By default the compiler should be able to reorder fields to eliminate internal padding so programmers don't have to worry about this, but people putting bits on a wire or dealing with c compatibility should be able to get that. We will need to properly design this out.
