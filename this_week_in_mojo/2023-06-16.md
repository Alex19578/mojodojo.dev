### Side Effect Propagation
Unfortunately, it is pretty impractical to define what `side effect free` means in a general purpose language; particularly one that wants you to be able to call existing python code.

In practice side effects would be so common that the model would have to be "add a keyword to opt-in/indicate/require that a function is side effect free", not "add a keyword saying it has side effects".

Given that, very few people would use it, and it would interfere with printf debugging and a lot of other things.

It's possible that there is a model here that will work and would be usable, but I'm not sure how much value it would provide.

### Sorting Algorithm discovered by AlphaDev
Sure, that algorithm could definitely be used inside the Mojo sort algorithm.  What they found is something you'd put into a standard library, e.g. they put it into the libc++ c++ standard library, eventually it could go into the Mojo stdlib.

### StringRef from LLVM
Yep that's where it came from. It is directly related to string_view in C++, the LLVM data structures predate the C++ STL growing all these things. The idea of a `pointer + extend without ownership` is more general than a `reference to a specific owning data structure` because it type erases the concrete storage type. For example, an LLVM StringRef can point into C array, an std::vector, or one of the zoo of other specialized storage types llvm has - it can even point to a scalar on the stack.

Per the comments above, I think actually calling this sort of type `ArrayRef` and `StringRef` in mojo would be super confusing if we have `ref` as a different concept. Python generally uses the word "Slice" for these things, and I think that would be great to use for these.

### `borrowed` keyword
I don't have strong opinions, but I have some concern about general programmers (i.e., those without Rust experience) and the word "borrow". It is a word that can be explained and has good meaning in the rust lexicon, but doesn't connote referencing something, and doesn't even appear in the rust language (they use the & sigil instead). This isn't to say that "borrow" or "borrowed" is bad, but it does have some challenges.
